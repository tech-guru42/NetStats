# NetworkStats
UWP to display WLAN and Cellular data usage

# Description
Application displays current network data usage, Download and Upload and gives you an option to change device static IP address in a easy way. You can save different IP address profiles. 

# Usage

Choose network you want to see the statistics on by clicking on button for WLAN or Cellular. Statistics will be displayed bellow. If the network is not connected, Wifi is off, or mobile data areunavailable the error message will be displayed. Sliding to the right will bring you to the IP management pivot. Here you can change devices static IP address. You can also save new IP address and give it a description. This function should give you option to use different IP address for various networks. This function is currently untested on mobile devices as Windows operating system on mobile phones has a restriction on manipulating static IP addresses. I am using PowerShell scripts to overcome this issue, but it is experimental at best in this phase.
